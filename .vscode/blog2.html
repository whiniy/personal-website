          On the first day of Wow Week, I really was not into it. It 
          was a hot day, and I was tired from the drive as well as 
          from moving in. However, I ended up in a great Wow group 
          as I made a new friend and found an old friend from high 
          school. My Wow leaders were also the best people I 
          could ask for. I am extremely grateful for the amount 
          of work and dedication they put into making the first 
          week fun and entertaining.

          By the end of the week, I no longer felt super awkward and 
          lost. I had gained a friend and got more comfortable with 
          talking to everyone. It was super fun getting many 
          opportunities to explore the campus as well as places 
          off-campus such as downtown and hikes. I even pledged for 
          the Fraternity that both my Wow leaders are in!

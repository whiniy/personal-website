        <p>On the first day of Wow Week, I really was not into it. It was a hot day, and 
          I was tired from the drive as well as from moving in. However, I ended up in a
          great Wow group as I made a new friend and found an old friend from high school.
          My Wow leaders were also the best people I could ask for. I am extremely grateful
          for the amount of work and dedication they put into making the first week fun and
          entertaining.

          By the end of the week, I no longer felt super awkward and lost. I had gained a
          friend and got more comfortable with talking to everyone. It was super fun getting
          many opportunities to explore the campus as well as places off-campus such as 
          downtown and hikes. I even pledged for the Fraternity that both my Wow leaders
          are in!
